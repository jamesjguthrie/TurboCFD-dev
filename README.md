# TurboCFD
### CFD toolbox running on CUDA

OpenFOAM solvers ported to Nvidia CUDA. All the calculations are done on the GPU giving a huge speed-up.
Still in development stage, waiting for your contribution!

### Features:
* most incompressible and compressible solvers on static mesh are available
* all the calculations are done on the GPU
* no overhead for GPU-CPU memory copy
* can run in parallel on multiple GPUs
